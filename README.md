# Email Generation Application

This is an implementation of an "Email Generation" application that serves various customer segments, including Business, Returning, Frequent, New, and VIP. The application generates personalized emails based on a base template tailored to each type of customer.

## Implementation Description

### Flexibility for Adding or Removing Object Types

The implementation of this application is designed to be highly flexible. It uses the Factory Method design pattern to create customer objects. This approach allows for easy addition of new customer types without modifying existing code. To add a new customer type, you can simply create a new concrete factory class that implements the `CustomerFactory` interface and add a corresponding concrete customer class that implements the `Customer` interface. Similarly, to remove a customer type, you can delete the corresponding classes without affecting the rest of the codebase. This flexibility ensures that the system can adapt to changes in customer segments.

### Simplicity and Understandability

The codebase is structured to be simple and understandable. We have organized classes and methods in a clear and modular way. Each class has a single responsibility, making the codebase easy to read and maintain. The naming conventions are clear, and we have provided comments and documentation to explain the purpose of each class and method. The use of design patterns, such as the Factory Method pattern, enhances the maintainability and understandability of the code by providing a common and well-documented architectural solution.

### Avoidance of Duplicated Code

We have ensured that there is no duplicated code in the application. The customer-specific email generation logic is encapsulated within individual customer classes, avoiding redundancy. The Factory Method design pattern further reduces code duplication by centralizing the object creation process. This not only enhances code maintainability but also makes the codebase more efficient and easier to manage.

### Design Pattern

The Factory Method design pattern has been employed in this implementation. It was chosen because it provides a systematic way to create objects without exposing the details of their creation. This pattern offers a high level of flexibility, making it suitable for accommodating new customer types in the future. By using this pattern, the codebase remains open for extension (to add new customer types) and closed for modification (existing code remains unchanged).

By adopting the Factory Method pattern, we've achieved a separation of concerns, making the codebase modular and maintainable while ensuring a high degree of flexibility for future expansions.
